# MultiFrogger
By Jose Alberto Chaves and Jorge Trejos.
### About
This project is a reboot of the classic 1981's arcade game [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger) but with a new feature: Multiplayer playability.

Two players will be able to compete with each other, through a network connection, to be the player with the highest score before the time ends.

### Game objective
Each player controls a frog trying to cross a road and a river to reach to the other side of the screen. The road has moving vehicles that act as obstacles that will kill a player's frog upon contact. The river has logs and turtles that act as platforms to cross the river; if a player makes a misstep and falls into the water, their frog will also die. Successfully reaching to the other side of the screen will earn the player 1 point. Dying will result in re-spawning at the beginning of the screen after a few seconds.
